 * class whose interface does not exist is a fatal error when it loads, and an
 * Email plugin from before inbound mail has no `InboundCapable`. So the plugin
 * registers this one only when `interface_exists(InboundCapable::class)`, and
 * the plain provider otherwise, which sends and reports deliveries exactly as
 * before. Everything, `inbound()` included, lives on the parent.
